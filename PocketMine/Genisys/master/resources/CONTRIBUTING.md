# Genisys Contribution Guidelines

You are likely to get banned if you don't follow the **bold rules** below.

### Questions

No questions on GitHub. Use Gitter or IRC to ask.  
Channel rule: **Don't ask to ask, if anyone is here or alive, or uses something. Just ask, and we'll get moving along. Thanks.**

### Issues

- **No questions.**
- **Follow the template.**
- Use English properly, or ask someone to examine your words.
- When posting a feature request, try to describe as much as you can, and don't make it too broad.
- Avoid generic titles like "Crash", "Help" or "Broken". Do your best as long as it fits in the line.
- Avoid unneeded emoji reactions, unless you're participating and providing informations.

### Code Contributions

- **Think twice before you use GitHub editor.** GitHub web doesn't provide every Git feature, and using the web editor means you haven't test the code.
- Test the code if you can. **Do not submit a PR if the CI fails.**
- Use descriptive commit messages. See [an example](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) here.
- One change per commit. Squash redundant commits.
